## NHentai
There's 3 commands in this plugin. All of the results are sent ephemerally (i.e, as Clyde message, only you can see them).
1) `/nhentai info`
- Gives you information about the comic in an embed.

2) `/nhentai pages`
- Gives you the pages of the comic as multiple embeds.  
(Images may take some time to load. If it doesn't load, then click (open) the image inside the embed and it may load faster)

3) `/nhentai search`
- Search NHentai just like the search feature in nhentai's website. Sends the result as embed.

### Dev note:
If you get `An unknown error occurred.` while using any of the commands, then check Debug Logs and send me a message either by pinging me in #plugin-support channel with the error or DM me about it.
